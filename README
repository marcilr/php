  PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for
  web development but also used as a general-purpose
  programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf
  in 1994,[3] the PHP reference implementation is now
  produced by The PHP Group.[4] PHP originally stood for
  Personal Home Page,[3] but it now stands for the recursive
  acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor[5]
