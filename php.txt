PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor

PHP is a general-purpose server-side scripting language
originally designed for Web development to produce dynamic
Web pages.  It is one of the first developed server-side
scripting languages to be embedded into an HTML source
document rather than calling an external file to process
data.  The code is interpreted by a Web server with a
PHP processor module which generates the resulting Web
page.

NOTE: Think I like this old first description best!


PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for
web development but also used as a general-purpose
programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf
in 1994,[3] the PHP reference implementation is now
produced by The PHP Group.[4] PHP originally stood for
Personal Home Page,[3] but it now stands for the recursive
acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor[5]

Dynamically generated content is required.  Whilst I
somewhat like jsp - I have it out for java.
PHP is suitable.  Should probably learn ruby:)
